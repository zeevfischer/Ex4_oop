### This repository contains an implementation of Pokemon game!!
### The game is being played on a directed weighted graph that implemented in Python(on last assigment)!
---
### How to play the game?
The pokemons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take the proper edge to “grab” the pokemon while each pokemon contains a value of points.
The goal is to maximize the overall sum of points of the “grabbed” pokemons at a given limited time.
---
###How to run the game?
locate thr server and the data folder in the same folder
run cmd
enter java -jar Ex4_Server_v0.0.jar [state_number]
NOTE: state_number is a integer between 1-15
run another cmd
then run python3 

### What does the game contains? <br>
- Given graph
- Amount of agents
- Amount of pokemons that appears on the graph edges at every given moment
